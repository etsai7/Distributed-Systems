## Part 1: Using Using UDP/IP
Using the unreliable UDP/IP protocol, we wrote a tool that reliably copies a file to another machine. The tool consists of two programs: 
* `ncp` - the sender process.
* `rcv` - the receiver process.
In order to perform a file transfer operation, a receiver process (`rcv`) should be run on the target machine.  

### ncp
A **sender process** (`ncp`) should be run on the source machine using the following interface:

`ncp <loss_rate_percent> <source_file_name> <dest_file_name>@<comp_name>` where `<comp_name>` is the name of the computer where the server runs (ugrad1, ugrad2, etc.)

### rcv
A **receiver process** (`rcv`) handles an UNLIMITED number of file-transfer operations, but it is allowed to handle one operation at a time (sequence them). If a sender comes along while the receiver is busy, the sender is blocked until the receiver completes the current transfer. The sender should know about this and report this. The receiver process has the following interface:

`rcv <loss_rate_percent>` where loss rate is the percentage loss of sent packets. e.g., rcv 10 will drop 10 percent before sending. A sender process (`npc`) handles one operation and then terminates. We assume that the source file name represents a specific single file.

To check the software, each process (both `rcv` and `npc`) should be calling a coat routine named [`sendto_dbg`](#part3) instead of the `sendto` system call. The coat routine will allow control of an emulated network loss percentage for each sent packet.

**Note:** THIS SHOULD BE DONE FOR EVERY SEND OPERATION IN THE CODE (both for the sender and the receiver).

Both the sender (`ncp`) and the receiver (`rcv`) programs should two statistics every 100 Mbytes of data sent/received IN ORDER (all the data from the beginning of the file to that point was received with no gaps):
    1) The total amount of data (in Mbytes) successfully transferred by that time.
    2) The average transfer rate of the last 100Mbytes sent/received (in Mbits/sec).

At the end of the transfer, both sender and receiver programs should report the size of the file transferred, the amount of time required for the transfer, and the average rate at which the communication occurred (in Mbits/sec).

## Part 2: Using Using TCP/IP

Using the reliable TCP/IP protocol, we implement the corresponding `t_ncp` and `t_rcv`. These report the amount of data transferred and the rate, the same way as `ncp` and `rcv` programs. The `t_rcv` is not required to handle multiple senders. It can handle a single sender and then exit.

## Artifical Loss
The coat routine `sendto_dbg` has a similar interface to `sendto` (see `man 2 sendto`). The `sendto_dbg` routine will randomly decide to discard packets in order to create additional network message omissions based on the loss rate. An initialization routine, `sendto_dbg_init`, should be called once, in the beginning of each scenario, to set the loss rate for that scenario.
